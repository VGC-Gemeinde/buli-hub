# Production image for Cloud Run (docs/deployment.md). Multi-stage:
# dependencies → build → minimal runtime with Next's standalone output.
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_* values are inlined into the client bundle at BUILD time —
# they must be passed as build args (the deploy workflow does), not set on
# the running container. Server-only secrets are runtime env on Cloud Run.

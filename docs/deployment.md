# Deployment runbook

Production = one Cloud Run service (region **europe-west1**, Belgium — Cloud Run domain mapping is not available in Frankfurt) + one
hosted Supabase project. Every push to `main` deploys via
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` (checks → image → migrations → deploy). This
runbook is the one-time setup; keep it current when infrastructure changes.

Placeholders used below: `buli-hub`, `<DOMAIN>` (e.g. `bulihub.de`),
`<GH_REPO>` (e.g. `owner/buli-hub`).

## 1. Supabase project

1. Create a project (org plan: **Pro** — daily backups; the free tier pauses
   on inactivity). Region: Frankfurt (`eu-central-1`).
2. **Auth → Providers → Discord**: enable; client ID/secret from the Discord
   Developer Portal (the production application — staging and local use a
   separate one, see §7). In the
   Discord portal, add the redirect
   `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
3. **Auth → URL configuration**: Site URL `https://<DOMAIN>`; additional
   redirect URLs: `https://<DOMAIN>/**`.
4. **Auth → Providers → Email**: disable sign-ups (Discord is the only way
   in).
5. Note the values for later: project URL, publishable key, secret key, and
   both connection strings — **session** (port 5432, for migrations) and
   **transaction pooler** (port 6543, for the app; `prepare: false` is
   already set app-side).
6. The schema arrives via the deploy workflow's `drizzle-kit migrate` on the
   first deploy — nothing to apply by hand.

## 2. Google Cloud project

```bash
gcloud projects create buli-hub   # or reuse; link billing
gcloud config set project buli-hub
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  iamcredentials.googleapis.com secretmanager.googleapis.com \
  monitoring.googleapis.com
gcloud artifacts repositories create buli-hub --repository-format=docker \
  --location=europe-west1
```

### Deployer service account + Workload Identity Federation

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create github-deployer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding buli-hub \
  --member="serviceAccount:github-deployer@buli-hub.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/run.admin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding buli-hub \
  --member="serviceAccount:github-deployer@buli-hub.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/artifactregistry.writer"
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  "$(gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter=compute --format='value(email)')" \
  --member="serviceAccount:github-deployer@buli-hub.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"

gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create github --location=global
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers create-oidc github \
  --location=global --workload-identity-pool=github \
  --issuer-uri="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  --attribute-mapping="google.subject=assertion.sub,attribute.repository=assertion.repository" \
  --attribute-condition="assertion.repository=='VGC-Gemeinde/buli-hub'"
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  github-deployer@buli-hub.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role="roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser" \
  --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/attribute.repository/VGC-Gemeinde/buli-hub"
```

### Secrets (runtime, injected into Cloud Run)

```bash
printf '%s' '<value>' | gcloud secrets create DATABASE_URL --data-file=-          # transaction pooler, port 6543
printf '%s' '<value>' | gcloud secrets create SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY --data-file=-
printf '%s' '<value>' | gcloud secrets create DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN --data-file=-
# Grant the *runtime* service account access:
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding DATABASE_URL \
  --member="serviceAccount:<PROJECT_NUMBER>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"   # repeat per secret
```

### Cloud Run service (first deploy creates it; then pin the config)

```bash
gcloud run deploy buli-hub --image <first image> --region europe-west1 \
  --no-invoker-iam-check \
  --min-instances=1 --max-instances=3 --memory=512Mi \
  --set-secrets=DATABASE_URL=DATABASE_URL:latest,SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY:latest,DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN:latest \
  --set-env-vars=APP_BASE_URL=https://<DOMAIN>,DISCORD_GUILD_ID=…,DISCORD_ROLE_ID_DEV=…,DISCORD_ROLE_ID_ADMIN=…,DISCORD_ROLE_ID_STAFF=…,DISCORD_RESULTS_CHANNEL_ID=…
```

`min-instances=1` during the season (no cold starts); drop to 0 off-season.
Later deploys from CI only swap the image — env/secrets stick to the service.
`--no-invoker-iam-check` (instead of `--allow-unauthenticated`): the GCP
project sits under the VGC-Gemeinde organization, whose Domain Restricted
Sharing policy forbids `allUsers` IAM bindings — this flag is Cloud Run's
supported way to serve public traffic under that policy.

### Domain

Cloud Run → custom domain mapping for `<DOMAIN>`, then set the DNS records
it prints at the registrar. `APP_BASE_URL`, the Supabase site URL, and the
Datenschutz page's imprint must all match the final domain.

## 3. GitHub repository configuration

Settings → Environments → **PROD** (the deploy job declares
`environment: PROD` — values anywhere else are not injected):

| Kind | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Variable | `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | `buli-hub` |
| Variable | `GCP_REGION` | `europe-west1` |
| Variable | `GCP_ARTIFACT_REPO` | `buli-hub` |
| Variable | `GCP_SERVICE` | `buli-hub` |
| Variable | `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` | `projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/providers/github` |
| Variable | `GCP_DEPLOYER_SA` | `github-deployer@buli-hub.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |
| Variable | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co` |
| Variable | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | `sb_publishable_…` |
| Secret | `PROD_DATABASE_URL` | **session** connection string (port 5432) — migrations need DDL over a stable session, not the transaction pooler |

Then: install the **Renovate** GitHub app on the repo (config is
`renovate.json`; weekly, grouped minor/patch — CI gates every update PR).

## 4. Observability & backups (minimal)

- **Uptime check** (Cloud Monitoring) on `https://<DOMAIN>/` + alert to the
  maintainer's email.
- **Log-based alert**: Cloud Run revision logs, filter `severity>=ERROR`,
  notify on new entries (catches failed Discord syncs — they log via
  `console.error`).
- **Backups**: Supabase Pro does daily backups; verify the first one exists
  after go-live and note the restore path (Dashboard → Database → Backups).

## 5. Dress rehearsal (before announcing)

On the deployed service: sign in with a real Discord account → role sync
picks up the real guild roles → open a throwaway registration → register →
close → seed → create schedule → report a match → the post appears in the
results channel → drop/un-drop a player → wipe the throwaway season
(open a fresh registration window when the real one starts). Verify the
uptime check is green and a forced error shows up in Cloud Logging.

## 6. Cloning production

`npm run db:clone-prod` copies production into another database and turns it
into a test fixture. It solves two problems the local stack cannot:

- **Migrations are otherwise only ever tested against an empty database.** CI
  builds the schema from scratch with no rows in it, so the migrations that
  actually break — a `NOT NULL` on a column that has nulls, a unique index
  existing rows violate, a backfill that is instant on 10 rows — can only fail
  in production, during a deploy.
- **Features are otherwise only ever tested against invented data.** Seed
  fixtures cover the edge cases you thought of. The half-finished season, the
  division with an odd player count, the player who dropped mid-matchday and
  the name with an emoji in it are the ones you didn't.

### Prerequisites

- `pg_dump` and `psql` on PATH, at least as new as the server's major version
  (`pg_dump` refuses to dump from a newer server). The script checks this and
  names the version you need. Ubuntu ships 16; newer needs the PGDG repository.
- `PROD_DATABASE_URL` in `.env` — a **session-mode** connection to production
  (port 5432, not the 6543 transaction pooler: a dump needs a stable session
  and DDL).

  Take the **Session pooler** string from the dashboard (*Connect* → *Session
  pooler*), not the direct `db.<ref>.supabase.co` one. Supabase serves direct
  connections over **IPv6 only** unless the project has the IPv4 add-on, and
  most networks — WSL2 and GitHub-hosted runners among them — have no IPv6
  egress, so the direct string fails with `Network is unreachable`. The session
  pooler is IPv4 and is also port 5432. Its username carries the project ref:

  ```
  postgresql://postgres.<project-ref>:<password>@aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
  ```

> `DATABASE_URL` stays pointed at the local stack — it is the *write target*,
> and it is also what `npm run dev`, `drizzle-kit` and the integration tests
> use. Putting a production string there points the whole toolchain at
> production; the test suite truncates tables on startup.

> **`npm test` destroys a clone.** The integration tests clear shared tables in
> `beforeAll`, against whatever `DATABASE_URL` points at. That is harmless — it
> is only ever the local stack — but it means a clone and a test run cannot
> coexist. Re-run `db:clone-prod` afterwards; it takes well under a minute.

### Usage

```bash
npm run db:clone-prod -- --dry-run                 # show the plan, touch nothing
npm run db:clone-prod                              # clone as-is into the local stack
npm run db:clone-prod -- --shift="30 days"         # …and move every date 30 days later
npm run db:clone-prod -- --shift="-2 weeks 6 hours"
```

`--shift` is the highest-value flag: a dump is frozen at one moment in the
season, and offsetting every timestamp by one interval moves "today" to
wherever the test needs it — the day before a deadline, mid-matchday,
post-season. The same interval applies to every timestamp column in `public`
(enumerated from `information_schema`, so new tables are covered automatically),
which is what keeps the data internally consistent.

Full flag list: `npm run db:clone-prod -- --help`.

### What it does

1. **Dump** `public`, `drizzle` and the two `auth` tables from production.
   Read-only; production is never written to. The app dump is then filtered:
   production carries default-privilege ACLs for `supabase_admin`, and
   replaying those fails with `permission denied to change default privileges`
   on any target where you are not that role. Only those statements are
   removed — grants, policies and RLS all come across
   (`src/features/dev/clone/restore.ts`).
2. **Restore** into the target, replacing its `public` and `drizzle` schemas
   and its auth users outright.
3. **Scrub** (only with `--scrub`, see below).
4. **Clear `discord_posts`** — the copied rows point at message ids in the
   production channels, which the local/staging bot cannot reach.
5. **Shift dates** (only with `--shift`).
6. **Migrate.** Because the drizzle journal came across with the dump, the
   target inherits production's migration position, so `drizzle-kit migrate`
   applies exactly the migrations production has not seen yet — against
   production-shaped data. **This step is the migration rehearsal.** If it
   fails here, it would have failed in production.

### The privacy rule

Cloning copies real personal data: Discord ids, usernames, nicknames, avatars,
email addresses, social handles, the free text players wrote about themselves,
and their competitive history.

**Scrub when the clone lands somewhere that widens access.**

- *Local clone → no scrub.* You already have production database access; a
  clone on your own machine does not expand who can see the data, and
  scrubbing would only reduce the realism you are cloning for.
- *Staging clone → scrub.* Staging is reachable by more people. The script
  enforces this: a non-local target without `--scrub` is refused.

`CLONE_KEEP_DISCORD_IDS` exempts an allow-list of tester Discord ids from
everything below, so those people sign in as themselves and land on their own
copied data.

**What `--scrub` rewrites**

| Kind | Fields | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | `profiles.display_name`, `username`, `avatar_url`; `auth.users.email`, `raw_user_meta_data`, `phone`; `auth.identities.identity_data`, `provider_id` | replaced with synthetic values |
| Social | `profiles.twitter_handle`, `bluesky_handle` | replaced, null stays null |
| Free text | `registrations.prev_name`, `greatest_achievements`; `disputes.reason`, `note` | replaced, null and rough length preserved |
| Quasi-identifier | `registrations.prev_season` / `prev_division` / `prev_placement` | **permuted between users** |

Three of those choices are deliberate and worth keeping:

- **Replaced, never deleted.** Nulling the social handles would mean no cloned
  profile ever renders a social link, so that part of the UI would go untested
  against realistic data — the opposite of why the clone exists. Same reason
  null-ness and rough length are preserved in the free-text fields.
- **Synthetic names keep what breaks layouts** — umlauts, emoji, very long
  names, mention-like strings, right-to-left text. Anonymising into
  "User 1..N" would remove exactly the realism being cloned for. A unit test
  asserts the fixture list still has each property.
- **Veteran history is permuted, not cleared.** A past season/division/
  placement triple is a published result, and nearly all of them are unique, so
  it names a real person however the display name reads. Permuting keeps the
  multiset of values — the seeding tool still sees a realistic spread — while
  no row keeps the history of the person it belongs to.

`profiles.origin` is left alone on purpose: roughly a dozen distinct values
across the whole user base makes it a category rather than free text.

### What the scrub cannot do

**A clone is pseudonymised, not anonymised.** Once a season is running, the
placements, matches and results come across identically to production. Anyone
holding both the staging data and the published standings can re-link every
player — "whoever is 7–0 at the top of Division 1a" is one person, whatever
name is displayed. That is inherent to cloning for realism: the shape of the
data cannot be preserved and its linkage removed at the same time.

So the scrub is not the primary control. The staging URL is unlisted and
`noindex`, and `/dev` needs `DEV_TOOLS_TOKEN` — those are what limit who holds
the data in the first place. `auth.users.created_at` / `last_sign_in_at` and
the user UUIDs also survive, being needed for foreign keys and weakly
identifying at most.

### Safety

The script drops and recreates the target's `public` and `drizzle` schemas, so
it refuses to run when:

- source and target are the same database,
- the target is `PROD_DATABASE_URL`,
- the target is not localhost and `CLONE_ALLOW_REMOTE_TARGET=true` is not set,
- the target is not localhost and `--scrub` was not passed.

### Working with cloned data

`/dev` gains a picker listing every copied user with their role and division.
Choosing one signs you in as that person via `/dev/login-as`, so you see
exactly their season, matches and results — the fastest way to reproduce
what a player reports. Role sync stays off outside production
(`DISCORD_GUILD_ID` and the three role ids unset), so the roles that came
across in the clone freeze exactly as they were.

## 7. Staging environment

A second deployment fed by cloned production data, so features and migrations
meet realistic data before production does. Local development covers most of
that (§6); staging exists for what local cannot do — rehearse migrations at
production data volume, exercise the real Discord OAuth round-trip through a
hosted Supabase project, verify Cloud Run behaviour (container, secrets, cold
starts), and provide a URL you can hand to a staff member.

| | Local | Staging | Production |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runs** | `npm run dev` | Cloud Run `buli-hub-staging` | Cloud Run `buli-hub` |
| **Database** | Supabase CLI (Docker) | Supabase project #2 | Supabase project #1 |
| **Deployed from** | — | push to `dev` | push to `main` |
| **Data** | prod clone, on demand | prod clone, on demand | real |
| **Discord sign-in** | personas, or non-prod app | non-prod app | prod app |
| **Discord role reads** | off | off | real guild |
| **Discord posting** | test server | test server | real guild |
| **`/dev` tooling** | on | on (token) | **off** |
| **Public** | no | unlisted | yes |

### How the Discord configuration splits

Three independent concerns, three independent settings — which is what makes
this safe without any code changes:

1. **Sign-in** — `SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET`. Local
   and staging both use the **non-production** Discord application, never the
   production one. Local development can also leave these as placeholders and
   sign in through `/dev` personas instead, which never touch Discord.
2. **Role reads** — `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` + the three role ids. **Left unset on
   local and staging.** `roleConfig()` returns null without all four, and
   `syncMember()` then returns the *stored* role unchanged, so the roles that
   came across in the clone freeze as they were. Nothing needs a test-server
   membership, and the staging role distribution mirrors the real one — more
   realistic than live reads would be.
3. **Posting** — `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` + channel ids. Staging posts to the
   **test** server. An unset channel id skips posting entirely, so a
   half-configured test server degrades to silence rather than to errors or
   misdirected messages.

Because they are independent, needing a test server for *posting* does not
force *role reads* through it. (Pointing role reads at the real guild from
staging would need the bot in both guilds, and "invite it with no permissions"
is not safe — a bot inherits `@everyone` permissions and can end up able to
post in public production channels. Keeping reads off avoids this entirely.)

Discord user ids are global, so `auth.identities.provider_id` stays valid in a
clone: signing into staging with a real Discord account resolves to the copied
user row — for the tester ids listed in `CLONE_KEEP_DISCORD_IDS`, which the
scrub leaves untouched.

### Supabase project #2

Same steps as §1, with these differences: enable the Discord provider with the
**non-production** application's credentials, and add
`https://<staging-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` to that application's
redirect URLs in the Discord Developer Portal. Email sign-ups disabled, as in
production. No schema needs applying by hand — the first deploy or refresh
supplies it.

If no non-production Discord application exists yet, create one now (Developer
Portal → *New Application*). It supplies two separate things staging needs: the
OAuth client ID/secret above, and — under *Bot* — the token that becomes
`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_TEST`. Never reuse the production application for either;
resetting its secret to recover it would break sign-in for the whole league.
Add `http://127.0.0.1:54321/auth/v1/callback` to the same application while you
are there, so the OAuth round-trip can also be exercised locally.

**Site URL and redirect URLs must wait for the Cloud Run URL**, which is only
generated when the service is created. Come back and set them after the next
step.

### Cloud Run service

Same project, region and Artifact Registry repository as production; image tags
differentiate.

```bash
gcloud run deploy buli-hub-staging --image <first image> --region europe-west1 \
  --no-invoker-iam-check \
  --min-instances=0 --max-instances=2 --memory=512Mi \
  --set-secrets=DATABASE_URL=STAGING_DATABASE_URL_POOLER:latest,SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=STAGING_SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY:latest,DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_TEST:latest \
  --set-env-vars=APP_ENV=staging,APP_BASE_URL=https://<staging-url>,ENABLE_DEV_TOOLS=true,DEV_TOOLS_TOKEN=<long random string>,DISCORD_RESULTS_CHANNEL_ID=<test server channel>
```

Differences from production, each for a reason:

- `--min-instances=0` — cold starts are fine here, and it costs nothing idle.
- **No custom domain.** Staging is reachable only at its generated
  `*.run.app` URL: public, but unguessable and unlisted. `APP_ENV=staging`
  makes the app serve a disallow-all `robots.txt` and an
  `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` header, so a pasted link cannot get it
  indexed.
- `APP_BASE_URL` must be the staging URL, or the „Zum Match" links in Discord
  posts point at production.
- **No role variables** — see above.
- `ENABLE_DEV_TOOLS=true` + `DEV_TOOLS_TOKEN` turn on `/dev` (see below).

### Getting into `/dev` on staging

Everything under `/dev` returns **404** until the browser holds the unlock
cookie — the same response a missing route gives, so the staging URL alone does
not reveal that dev tooling is there. The cost is that a legitimate 404 looks
identical to a broken one; if `/` works and `/dev` 404s, you are simply not
unlocked.

The token lives only on the service. Print your unlock link with:

```bash
echo "$(gcloud run services describe buli-hub-staging --project=buli-hub --region=europe-west1 \
  --format='value(status.url)')/dev/unlock?token=$(gcloud run services describe buli-hub-staging \
  --project=buli-hub --region=europe-west1 \
  --format='value(spec.template.spec.containers[0].env)' | tr ';' '\n' \
  | grep DEV_TOOLS_TOKEN | sed "s/.*'value': '\([^']*\)'.*/\1/")"
```

Open it once per browser; the cookie lasts a week. Then use the picker on
`/dev` to impersonate a cloned user — `/dev/login-as` needs `?userId=<uuid>`
and returns 400 on its own.

> **`ENABLE_DEV_TOOLS` and `DEV_TOOLS_TOKEN` must never be set on the
> production service.** Together they allow signing in as any user. This is a
> deployment property, not a code guarantee: nothing in CI can catch it,
> because CI never inspects the production service's environment. If you ever
> touch production's env vars, check these two are absent.

### GitHub environment `STAGING`

Settings → Environments → **STAGING**, same variables as PROD (§3) with
staging values — `GCP_SERVICE` is `buli-hub-staging`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`
point at project #2 — plus:

| Kind | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Secret | `STAGING_DATABASE_URL` | staging **session** connection string (port 5432) |
| Secret | `PROD_DATABASE_URL` | production session string — the refresh workflow reads from it |
| Variable | `CLONE_KEEP_DISCORD_IDS` | comma-separated tester Discord ids exempt from the scrub |

`GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` and `GCP_DEPLOYER_SA` are the same values as
PROD; the deployer service account already has `run.admin` on the project.

### Two triggers, deliberately separate

| Action | Trigger | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Build, migrate, deploy | push to `dev` | Fast. **Keeps existing data.** |
| Clone production | *Refresh staging from production* → Run workflow | Fresh prod-shaped baseline, scrubbed, then migrate. |

The instinct is "every staging deploy refreshes the database". That backfires:
you deploy, build up test state, find a bug, push a fix — and the refresh wipes
the state you were testing with. Every push would destroy the setup you just
made. Both paths end with `drizzle-kit migrate`, so staging is always at the
current schema either way.

### Working on `dev`

`dev` is the working branch; `main` is the release branch. Work lands on `dev`
and reaches production only by promotion.

**`main` is protected** — direct pushes are rejected for everyone, including
admins, and a promotion PR requires the `checks` job to pass. The protection is
a GitHub ruleset named `main-protection`; to lift it in an emergency, disable
that ruleset in Settings → Rules, push, and re-enable it.

```bash
git checkout dev && …                       # commit freely; each push → staging
gh pr create --base main --head dev --title "<feature>"
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch=false   # one commit on main → production
git checkout dev && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main && git push --force-with-lease
```

That last line is required, not tidying. A squash-merge creates one new commit
on `main` while `dev` keeps the originals: same tree, divergent history. Without
the reset the next promotion computes the old merge base, replays commits that
are already on `main`, and conflicts. Resetting `dev` onto `main` after every
promotion keeps the two a single line.

Merge commits would avoid the reset, at the cost of putting every intermediate
`dev` commit on `main` — which is why the squash is kept (see CLAUDE.md's
one-commit-per-feature rule).

A production hotfix that cannot wait for whatever is on `dev` goes on a branch
off `main` and straight into a PR to `main`; afterwards reset `dev` onto `main`
as above.

### Cost

Supabase project #2 is compute only on a Pro organisation, roughly $10/month
for the smallest instance. The free tier is not an option: it pauses on
inactivity, which is exactly what a rarely-used staging environment does.
Cloud Run staging is effectively free at `min-instances=0`; staging images
share the existing Artifact Registry repository.

(Supabase's own Branching feature seeds branches from migrations and a seed
file rather than from production data — the opposite of what this is for.)

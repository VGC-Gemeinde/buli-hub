# Discord result posts

**Status: done** (2026-07-05) — `discord_posts` schema, message builders,
converge sync, hooks in all reporting/MotW actions, env template. Verified
via unit/integration tests, typecheck, and a production build; posting
against a real channel still needs a manual pass with
`DISCORD_RESULTS_CHANNEL_ID` pointed at a test channel (maintainer step —
the local stack has no Discord credentials for it).

## Context

Match results should reach the community where it lives: a Discord results
channel. Every publicly visible result gets a message in the historical
community format (pairings readable, score behind Discord spoiler tags, fixed
message shape). The Match of the Week is excluded — a result post would
defeat its spoiler protection — and instead gets one announcement when its
VOD link lands. The channel **mirrors the hub's public state**: one message
per match, edited or deleted as the state changes, with a message id stored
per post.

Discord stays a thin output channel (CLAUDE.md): posting is best-effort after
the DB write and never decides or blocks anything. No UI — this slice is
schema + logic + action hooks.

## Scope

**In:**
- **Result posts** whenever a result becomes *publicly visible*: normal
  player report, staff-confirmed free win (not the pending report), staff
  awards (free win / double loss). Corrections **edit** the message (with a
  trailing `*(korrigiert)*` line); reopen **deletes** it; a re-report posts
  fresh.
- **MotW exclusion, symmetric**: a featured match never gets a result post.
  Selecting a MotW deletes an already-existing result post for that match;
  removing the pick re-posts the (public) result. The channel always matches
  what the hub shows openly.
- **MotW VOD post** (`kind = motw_vod`): posted when a YouTube link is first
  attached, edited when the link changes, deleted when the link or the pick
  is removed. Never contains the result.
- **Self-healing**: an edit/delete hitting 404 (message removed on Discord)
  re-posts (result) or drops the row (delete) and stores the new id.
- Config via env: `DISCORD_RESULTS_CHANNEL_ID` (unset → posting skipped
  entirely, so local dev stays silent) and `APP_BASE_URL` (unset → posts
  carry no hub link). Both in `.env.example`; production values via Secret
  Manager.

**Out (deferred):**
- Retry queue / delivery guarantees — a missed or stale post logs an error
  and self-corrects on the next state change. Discord rate limits (bursts at
  the Spieltag deadline) fall under the same best-effort rule.
- Embeds, per-post-type channels, pairing announcements, backfill of results
  reported before this feature ships.

## Message format (community format, hub vocabulary)

Normal result, Showdown — fixed shape, score spoilered, both names bold
(never only the winner). The Game 3 line always exists: it carries the real
game-3 replay, or **repeats game 2's replay as a decoy** when the series
ended 2-0, so the message shape never leaks the split:

```
__**VGC Bundesliga · Division 1a · Spieltag 3**__

**Alice**  ||2 - 0||  **Bob**

Team von Alice: https://pokepast.es/…
Team von Bob: https://pokepast.es/…

Game 1: *https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/…*
Game 2: *https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/…*
Game 3: ||*https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/…*||

Zum Match: <https://…/match/{id}>
```

- **Cartridge**: team lines plus `Video: *…*` when set (italic like the
  replay lines, unspoilered — the score spoiler above is the only cover; the
  link itself leaks nothing); no game lines.
- **Free win / double loss**: header + `**Alice**  ||Freewin für Alice||
  **Bob**` (the winner must live inside the spoiler — outside it would leak,
  omitted entirely it would be lost) or `||Doppelniederlage||`, + hub link.
  No teams, no free-win reason (staff-internal).
- **Corrected**: trailing `*(korrigiert)*` line.
- Hub link wrapped in `<>` (suppresses the embed preview); team/replay links
  raw, as historically.
- **MotW VOD post**: header `__**VGC Bundesliga · Match of the Week ·
  Spieltag 3**__`, line `**Alice** vs. **Bob** — das VOD ist da!`, the
  YouTube URL **unwrapped** (the video preview is the announcement), hub
  link in `<>`.

## Data — new table `discord_posts`

```
id          uuid PK default random
kind        enum discord_post_kind: result | motw_vod
match_id    uuid FK → matches (cascade)
channel_id  text      -- posts stay editable if the configured channel moves
message_id  text
created_at  timestamptz default now
updated_at  timestamptz default now
unique (kind, match_id)
```

Migrations: `discord_posts` (generated) + `discord_posts_fk_rls` (custom:
FK, RLS on, no policies — server-only).

## Feature folder — `src/features/discord-posts/`

**Pure logic (`messages.ts`, unit-tested):**
- `resultMessage(input)` — the full result post text from match + result
  data: normal Showdown (incl. decoy game 3), normal Cartridge, free win,
  double loss, `(korrigiert)`, hub link present/absent.
- `motwVodMessage(input)` — the VOD announcement.
- `shouldPostResult(input)` — whether the channel should show a result post
  for a match (no public result → no; pending free win → no; featured as
  MotW → no) — the converge decision, exhaustively tested.

**Sync (`sync.ts`, best-effort — every entry point catches, logs, returns):**
- `syncResultPost(matchId)` — loads current state (match, result, MotW flag,
  stored post row), computes `resultPostState`, then converges: post / edit /
  delete / nothing. Handles 404-heal. Skips entirely without
  `DISCORD_RESULTS_CHANNEL_ID`.
- `syncMotwVodPost(matchId)` — same convergence for the VOD announcement.

**Queries (`queries.ts`, integration-tested):** `getPost(kind, matchId)`,
`upsertPost`, `deletePostRow`.

**`src/lib/discord.ts` additions:** `postChannelMessage`,
`editChannelMessage`, `deleteChannelMessage` — thin REST v10 calls with the
bot token, 404 surfaced as a typed outcome (not an exception).

## Hooks (existing actions call sync after their DB write + revalidate)

- `reportMatch` → `syncResultPost` (a pending free win converges to "none")
- `confirmFreeWin`, `awardFreeWin`, `awardDoubleLoss`, `editResult`,
  `reopenMatch` → `syncResultPost`
- `selectMotw` → `syncResultPost` for the newly featured match (deletes a
  prior result post) *and* for a replaced match (its result may return);
  `syncMotwVodPost` for a replaced pick (URL cleared → message deleted)
- `removeMotw` → `syncResultPost` + `syncMotwVodPost`
- `saveMotwYoutubeUrl` → `syncMotwVodPost`

## Dev tooling

`/dev/report-results?count=5` (linked from `/dev`, dev-only): reports up to
`count` open matches of the latest season like real player reports —
including the Discord sync — so the results channel can be exercised end to
end against a test channel. Without `DISCORD_RESULTS_CHANNEL_ID` it reports
the results and skips the posting, and says so.

## Tests

- Unit: `resultMessage` (all outcome/platform variants, decoy game 3,
  korrigiert, no-base-url), `motwVodMessage`, `resultPostState` (unreported /
  pending free win / confirmed / MotW-featured / corrected).
- Integration: `discord_posts` unique `(kind, match_id)`, row helpers.
- No tests against the real Discord API; `sync.ts` stays a thin shell around
  tested decisions.
- Manual: point `DISCORD_RESULTS_CHANNEL_ID` at a test channel; report,
  correct, reopen a match; confirm a free win; feature a reported match
  (post disappears), attach/replace/remove a VOD link.

## Delivery

Branch `feat/discord-result-posts`, squash-merged to main as one commit.

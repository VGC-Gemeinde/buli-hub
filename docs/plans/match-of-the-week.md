# Match of the Week

**Status: done** (2026-07-05) — schema + `src/features/motw/` + public block,
row badge, match-page spoiler, `/staff/motw` manager and dashboard todo.
Verified via unit/integration tests and a seeded running season (public
overview, featured match page, staff persona on `/staff` + `/staff/motw`).
**Design pass done** (2026-07-05) per `design/MATCH-OF-THE-WEEK.md` — navy
billboard, badge anatomy, manager filter chips/VOD chips, mobile stacking;
views only, plus `findMotw` now also carrying the players' standings ranks
for the billboard's "Platz {n}" sub-lines.

## Context

Each Spieltag (one week) the league features one match: the **Match of the
Week** — always called exactly that, never translated. Staff pick it at the
start of the week; it gets a prominent block on the public overview, later a
YouTube VOD link, and its result is never shown openly anywhere — spoiler
protection lets viewers watch the VOD first.

Rudimentary-but-intentional design; hand-off + design pass come later.

## Scope

**In:**
- **Selection** (staff+): pick one match per Spieltag — one MotW per
  `(window, round)`, league-wide across all divisions. Selectable rounds are
  the **current Spieltag and every later one** (a pick can be replaced or
  removed), **plus any past Spieltag that was never picked**, so a missed week
  can still be backfilled. A past round that already has a pick is settled —
  only its VOD link stays editable.
- **Staff todo**: on the staff season dashboard, a todo item when the *next*
  round has no MotW yet (warning character); if the *current* round has none,
  it is replaced by a more urgent item for this week. Purely informational —
  it never blocks anything (pairings etc.).
- **YouTube link**: staff attach/edit/remove a YouTube URL on any MotW,
  including past rounds (uploads can lag the Spieltag).
- **Public prominent block**: shown on the public overview only while its
  round is the current Spieltag: the pairing with division/group context, a
  "Watch on YouTube" button once the link exists, and the result behind
  click-to-reveal once reported. No MotW for the current round → no block.
- **Spoiler protection, permanent**: the MotW result is never shown openly
  and ignores the global spoiler switch. In the Spieltag match list (current
  *and* past rounds) the row shows the orange "MotW" cover pill instead of
  the score (tap reveals in place — the pill is the row's only marker, see
  `design/SPOILER-SCHUTZ.md` §2.3). On `/match/[matchId]` neutral viewers
  get the inline-masked result page with the MotW notice copy (participants
  and staff see everything, as today). Reveal state is client-side only —
  the score may exist in the payload; this is a courtesy spoiler tag, not
  security. The standings include the result immediately (accepted leak).

**Out (deferred):**
- Discord announcement of the MotW / VOD.
- MotW history/archive page.
- Any casting/scheduling workflow around the featured match.

## Data — new table `motw_selections`

```
id              uuid PK default random
window_id       uuid FK → registration_windows (cascade)
round           integer
match_id        uuid FK → matches (cascade), unique
youtube_url     text null
selected_by_id  uuid (FK → auth.users in the custom migration, cascade)
created_at      timestamptz default now
updated_at      timestamptz default now
unique (window_id, round)      -- one MotW per Spieltag
```

Migrations: `motw` (generated) + `motw_fk_rls` (custom: auth FK, RLS
public-read/deny-write as defense in depth, matching existing tables). The
server action validates that the match actually belongs to the given window
and round.

## Feature folder — `src/features/motw/`

**Pure logic (`motw.ts`, unit-tested):**
- `youtubeUrlSchema` / `isYoutubeUrl` — Zod: https, host is a YouTube domain
  (`youtube.com`, `www./m.youtube.com`, `youtu.be`).
- `motwTodo({ currentRound, totalRounds, selectedRounds })` →
  `null | { round, urgency: "warning" | "urgent" }` — urgent when the current
  round is unselected, else warning when a next round exists and is
  unselected. `null` outside the regular season / after the last round.
- `canSelectRound` / `selectableRounds` — the rounds open for picking (current
  … last, plus unpicked past ones); shared by the actions' round gate and the
  staff page.
- `weekState` / `initialMotwRound` / `sortCandidates` / `recordability` /
  `buildMotwWeeks` — the staff workspace's week model
  (`docs/plans/motw-week-workspace.md`).
- `findMotw(divisions, selection)` — locate the featured `PublicMatch` plus
  its group name inside the already-built overview divisions (no extra
  identity queries) for the prominent block.

**Queries (`queries.ts`, integration-tested):**
- `motwForWindow(windowId)` — all selections `{ round, matchId, youtubeUrl }`;
  feeds overview flagging, the block, and the staff view.
- `motwByMatchId(matchId)` — for the match page.
- `matchSelectionContext(matchId)` — window/round/bye of a match, the
  selection action's validation input.
- `upsertMotw` (replace clears the YouTube URL), `deleteMotw`,
  `setMotwYoutubeUrl` — persistence helpers; the latter two return the
  affected match id for revalidation.

**Actions (`actions.ts`, staff+ gate on each, `{ ok } | { ok:false, error }`,
`revalidatePath` on `/`, `/match/[matchId]`, `/staff`, `/staff/motw`):**
- `selectMotw({ matchId })` — derives window/round from the match, rejects
  byes and rounds other than current/next, upserts (replace allowed).
- `removeMotw({ round })` — clears the pick (current/next round only).
- `saveMotwYoutubeUrl({ round, url })` — validates via `youtubeUrlSchema`;
  `url: null` removes the link; allowed for any round.

## Views

- **Public overview** (`src/features/public-league/`): `publicLeagueOverview`
  additionally fetches `motwForWindow`; `PublicMatch` gains `isMotw` (scores
  stay filled — the block's reveal uses them); `PublicOverview` gains the
  current round's block data (or null). `<MotwBlock>` renders above the
  division switcher; `<MatchRow>` renders the orange MotW cover pill instead
  of any score for `isMotw` rows — every round, permanently (`<MotwBadge>`
  itself lives on in the match-page banner and the staff manager).
- **Match page** (`/app/match/[matchId]`): a `<MotwMatchBanner>` (badge +
  Spieltag + YouTube button) for every viewer; neutral viewers get the result
  summary wrapped in `<MotwSpoiler>` (pairing header + cover card,
  click-to-reveal). Participants and staff see the result as usual.
- **Staff** — new page `/staff/motw` (staff+ gate, redirects to `/staff`
  without a schedule): `<MotwManager>` is a one-week-at-a-time workspace with a
  season pager. Full spec: `docs/plans/motw-week-workspace.md`.
- **Staff season dashboard**: `<MotwTodoCard>` from `motwTodo` — warning
  variant ("Match of the Week für Spieltag N wählen") or urgent variant for
  the current round — linking to `/staff/motw`; the season strip carries a
  permanent "Match of the Week" button as the entry point once the todo is
  gone.

## Dev tooling

- Running-season seed: mark one match of the current round as MotW (with
  result, without YouTube link) so block, badge, and reveal are visible.
- Gallery: MotwBlock states (unplayed, result hidden, revealed, with/without
  YouTube button), MotW badge row, todo item in both urgencies.

## Tests

- Unit: `motwTodo` (unselected current → urgent; unselected next → warning;
  both unselected → urgent only; all selected / last round / off-season →
  null), `selectableRounds` (the actions' round gate — covered from both sides
  in `actions.integration.test.ts`), `youtubeUrlSchema`
  (https-only, domain allowlist, suffix-trick host), `findMotw` (found /
  unknown / bye).
- Integration: unique `(window_id, round)` constraint; `upsertMotw` insert +
  replace (clears the URL); `setMotwYoutubeUrl` set/clear/no-pick;
  `deleteMotw`; `matchSelectionContext`; `motwForWindow` shape.
- Manual: seed a running season; pick a MotW as staff persona; verify block,
  badge, match-page reveal, todo transitions, YouTube button.
